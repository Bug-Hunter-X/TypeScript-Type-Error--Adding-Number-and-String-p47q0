# TypeScript Type Error: Adding Number and String

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript that arises when attempting to add a number and a string. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers as input, but in the provided example, it receives a string as the second argument, leading to a compilation error.

The solution involves ensuring that both arguments passed to the function are of the correct type, either through explicit type checking or type assertion.
